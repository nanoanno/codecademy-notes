# Codecadmey Notes: Unit 1 - HTML

##DAY TWO
###Lesson: CSS Setup

**CSS** means _Cascading Style Sheets_

Although CSS is a different language than HTML, it's possible to write CSS code directly within HTML code using inline styles.

To style an HTML element, you can add the `style` attribute directly to the opening tag. After you add the attribute, you can set it equal to the CSS style(s) you'd like applied to that element.

If you'd like to add more than one style with inline styles, simply keep adding to the `style` attribute. Make sure to end the styles with a semicolon (`;`).
