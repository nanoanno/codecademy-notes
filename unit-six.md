# Codecadmey Notes: Unit 6 - CSS Documentation and Debugging

## DAY ONE-THREE
### LESSON: Documentation and Research

#### Documentation
Every well-developed language or framework has a place where you can look up all of its features. This library of information is called a language's documentation.

You can find documentation for CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and more at Mozilla Developer Network: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/

#### Google
Googling the problem you're trying to solve and the language you're using will yield many useful answers.

#### Stack Overflow
Stack Overflow is a useful resource where developers ask and answer questions. You should use it to find answers to your questions, and learn from experienced developers.
