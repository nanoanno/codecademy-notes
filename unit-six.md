# Codecadmey Notes: Unit 6 - CSS Documentation and Debugging

## DAY ONE-THREE
### LESSON: Documentation and Research

#### Documentation
Every well-developed language or framework has a place where you can look up all of its features. This library of information is called a language's documentation.

You can find the documentation for CSS at Mozilla Developer Network: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/

#### Google
Googling the problem you're trying to solve and the language you're using will yield many useful answers.
