REVIEW

1. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is used to create the structure and content of a webpage.
2. Most HTML elements contain opening and closing tags with raw text or other HTML tags between them.
3. Single-closing tags cannot enclose raw text or other elements.
4. Comments are written in HTML using the following syntax: <!-- comment -->.
5. HTML elements can be nested inside other elements. The enclosed element is the child of the enclosing parent element.
6. Whitespace between HTML elements helps make code easier to read while not changing how elements appear in the browser.
7. Indentation also helps make code easier to read. It makes parent-child relationships visible.
8. The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration should always be the first line of code in your HTML files.
9. The <html> element will contain all of your HTML code.
10. Information about the web page, like the title, belongs within the <head> of the page.
11. You can add a title to your web page by using the <title> element, inside of the head.
12. A webpage's title appears in a browser's tab.
13. Code for visible HTML content is placed inside of the <body> element.
